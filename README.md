# Image-classifier-to-identify-Dog-Breeds
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show, and youâ€™ve volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information. The registration system tags the images based on the biographical information.
